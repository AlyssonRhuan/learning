# Tasks

Tasks are the atomic unit of deployment within ECS. Tasks are made up of one or more tightly coupled containers.

A taks may run standalone, or it may be part of a service. A service is an abstraction on top of a task.

A service runs a specififed number of tasks and can include a load balancer to distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.
