# Tasks

Tasks are the atomic unit of deployment within ECS. Tasks are made up of one or more tightly coupled containers.

A taks may run standalone, or it may be part of a service. A service is an abstraction on top of a task.

A service runs a specififed number of tasks and can include a load balancer to distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.

# Task definition

Tasks are defined in a task definition. The task definition is a text file, in JSON format. Which describes one or more containers that together form an application. Tasks definition can be hought of as a blueprint for your application:

When using the EC2 launch type, tasks are hosted by EC2 instances, that are grouped into cluesters. Clusters are region-specific, but can span Availability Zones to increase resilience.

Each EC2 instance in the clusters runs Docker to support the containers that make up your tasks and also runs the `ECS agent`. The agent starts and stops tasks based on requests from ECS and send telemetry data about the instance's tasks and resource utilization to the `Amazon ECS backplane`.

The ECS backplane is the singular control plane for all of ECS, it is well scaled, robust and fault tolerant.

An EC@ instance that is running the ECS agent and has been registered into a cluster is referred to as an `ECS Container instance`. When you run tasks with Amazon ECS, your tasks using the EC2 launch type are placed on your active container instances. Proper placement strategies are key to maximizing tour efficiency and availability.
