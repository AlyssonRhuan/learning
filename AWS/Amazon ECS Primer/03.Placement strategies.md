# Task placement

This scenario has 10 container instances. You are making a request to run sime tasks or to create a service. As part of that request, you specify:

- `Cluster constants` satisfy CPU, memory and networking requirements;
- `Custom constants` filter for location, instance type, AMI or other custom attribute constraints;
- `Placement strategies` identify instances that meet spead or binpack placement strategy;
- `Apply filter` select final container instances for placement;

# Task definition

The task definition specifies the resources required in addition to the task placement information, that defines:

1. `Resources`: CPU, memory and networking;
2. `Placement strategies`: Best effort ( Random, Binpack, Spread );
3. `Placement constraints`: Binding ( distinctInstance, memberOf );
