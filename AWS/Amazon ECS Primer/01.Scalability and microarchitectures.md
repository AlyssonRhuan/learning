Running one or two containers on a single host is simples. Now imagine a full production environment with hundreds of hostos and maybe thousands of containers.
Now you are managing an enterprise-scale clustered environment. You need a way to place tou containers intelligently on instances to maximize availability, resilience and performance.

This is where container management plataforms come in. They handle the scheduling and placement of containers based on the underlying hardware infrastructure and the application needs.
They provide integration with other service such as networking, persistent storage, security, monitoring and logging.

Numerous options exists, but here we will focus on Amazon ECS.

# Amazon ECS

ECS is highly scalable, highly performing container orcherstration service that supports Docker container.
- The service enables you to easily run and sacale containerized applications on AWS.
- ECS provides its own schedulers but can also integrate with third-party schedulers to meet business or application-specific requirements.
- Is also tightly integrated with other AWS services.

# High-level overview of ECS

1. First, container images are pulled from a registry. These container images can come from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR), which is one of many AWS services that integrate with ECS, or they can be pulled from a third-party or private registry.

2. Next, you define your application: Customize the container images with the necessary code and resources, and then create the appropriate configuration files to group and define your containers as short-running tasks or long-running services within ECS. Weâ€™ll use services in this example.

3. When you are ready to bring your services online, you select one of two launch types. The Fargate launch type provides a near-serverless experience where the infrastructure supporting your containers is completely managed by AWS as a service. AWS manages the placement of your tasks on instances and makes sure that each task has the appropriate CPU and memory. With Fargate, you can focus on the tasks themselves and the application architecture instead of worrying about the infrastructure.

5. The EC2 launch type is useful when you want more control over the infrastructure supporting your tasks. When using the EC2 launch type , you create and manage clusters of EC2 instances to support your containers and you define the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements.

6. You have more granular control over your environment without needing to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems, or worry about scaling your management infrastructure. You can mix and match the two launch types as needed within your application. For example, you can launch services with more predictable resource requirements using EC2 and launch other services that are subject to wider swings in demand in Fargate. Regardless of the launch type you use, ECS manages your containers for availability and can scale your application as necessary to meet demand.
