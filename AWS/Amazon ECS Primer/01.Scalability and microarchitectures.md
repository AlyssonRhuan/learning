Running one or two containers on a single host is simples. Now imagine a full production environment with hundreds of hostos and maybe thousands of containers.
Now you are managing an enterprise-scale clustered environment. You need a way to place tou containers intelligently on instances to maximize availability, resilience and performance.

This is where container management plataforms come in. They handle the scheduling and placement of containers based on the underlying hardware infrastructure and the application needs.
They provide integration with other service such as networking, persistent storage, security, monitoring and logging.

Numerous options exists, but here we will focus on Amazon ECS.

# Amazon ECS

ECS is highly scalable, highly performing container orcherstration service that supports Docker container.
- The service enables you to easily run and sacale containerized applications on AWS.
- ECS provides its own schedulers but can also integrate with third-party schedulers to meet business or application-specific requirements.
- Is also tightly integrated with other AWS services.
