# Amazon EC2 instance types

Instance types are combinations of CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity. Each Amazon EC2 instance type is grouped under an instance family:

- `General purpose`, provide a good balance of resources, used for a variety of diverse workloads;
- `Compute optimized`, are ideal for compute-intensive tasks, like gaming servers, HPC and scientific modeling;
- `Memory optimized`, are good for memory-intensive tasks;
- `Accelerated computing`, are ideal for operations that utilize hardware accelerators, like floating point number calculations, graphics processing and data patter matching;
- `Storage optimized`, a good for a high performance for locally stored data.

# Amazon EC2 Billing options
- `On-Demand`, that means is that you only pay for the duration that your instance runs for;
- `Savings plans`, offers low prices on EC2 usage in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage measured in dollars per hour for a one or three-year term.
- `Reserved instances`, these are suited for steady-state workloads or ones with predictable usage and offer you up to a 75% discount versus On-Demand pricing;
- `Spot instances`, are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions. and they allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off of the OnDemand price;
- `Dedicated hosts`, which are physical hosts dedicated for your use for EC2.

# Benefits of Auto Scaling

Scalability involves beginning with only the resources that you need, and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in. As result, you pay for only that resources you use.

The AWS services that provides the functionality of the scaling process to happen automatically.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to an application, you can add new instances to the application when necessary and terminate them when no longer needed.

We can create the Auto Scaling Group, with the minimum capacity.

# ELB Elastic Load Balancing.

When we have multiple EC2 instances, all running the same program, for the same purpose, and requests comes in, the load balancer is an application that takes in requests and routes them to the instances to be processed.

The ELB has as properly high performance, cost-efficient, highly available and automatically scalable.

# Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

This is a message queuing service.

With Amazon SQS you can send, store and receive messages between software components, at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other service to be available.

# Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)

The Amazon SNS is a publish/subscribe service, using Amazon SNS topics we can publish messages to subscribers.

# Summarize additional AWS compute options.
1. Amazon EC2

Is recommended for host traditional applications and when you need full access to the OS

2. AWS Lambda

Is for host short running functions, service-oriented applications, event driven applications and no provisioning or managing servers

3. AWS Fargate

Serverless compute platform

Is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. When using AWS Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers, he manages your server infrastructure for you.

3. Amazon ECS

Orchestration tool

Is a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS.

4. Amazon EKS

Orchestration tool

Is a fully managed service that toy can use to run Kubernetes on AWS
