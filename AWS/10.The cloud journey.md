# AWS Well-Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, effcient and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud.
It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.

The Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars: 
- `Operational excellence` is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures;
- The `Security` pillar is the ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies;
- `Reliability` is the ability of a system to do the following:
    - Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions;
    - Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand;
    - Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues;
- `Performance efficiency` is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve;
- `Cost optimization` is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
