# Authentication and Autorization

EKS is tightly integrated with the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service through the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes. The authenticator is a tool to use AWS IAM credentials to authenticate to a Kubernetes cluester.

# ConfigMaps

Separating configuration information from the containers in your pods is desirable becousae it makes tour applications easy to deploy across multiple environments, such as dev, test, stagin and production.
It also allows the application to be more portable. Kubernetes has native constructs, such as ConfigMap and secrets that allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from the image content to keep containierized applications portable. You can also use other service, such as AWS Parameter Store.

In this example, we create a new ConfigMap named my-config from the file named myparams.

# Secrets

Sensitive information should be stored as secret. The Kubernetes secret object allows you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens and ssh keys.

# Pod access secrets

Here is an example of consuming the secret as a pod environment variable.

# DemonSets

A DeanonSet is a type of controller that make sure that all nodes have a copy of the requests pod. This is useful to provide common supporting functionality ( such as security, logging, monitoring or backups ) for the pods running your application code.
