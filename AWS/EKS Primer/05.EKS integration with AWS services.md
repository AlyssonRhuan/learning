# EKS integration

One of the strengths of running container-based workloads with EKS is the tight integrations with other AWS services.

- Amazon Simple Notification (Amazon SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue (Amazon SQS) services for decoupling;
- Classic, applications and network load balancers;
- Route 53 for DNS and service discovery;
- Identify and Access Management (IAM) for authentication and authorization;
- Secrets Manager for managing encrypted passwords, credentials, tokens and other secrets;
- API Gateway to expose the services to the outside world;
- AWS developer tools, suchas CodePipeline, for continuous integrations and continuous development (CI/CD);
- Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alerting.
