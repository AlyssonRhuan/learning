# Manage Node Groups

By defaul, you manage the worker nodes in the cluster an the applications that run on them, you also manage how pods are placed on your worker nodes.
Managed nodes run using the lastes EKS-optimized Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in your account.

# AWS Fargate

EKS run your pods on AWS Fargate, that provides on-demand, right-sized compute capacity. With Fargate, you no longer have to provision, scale or manage EC2 instance for
your EKS cluster.

# Fargate profiles

You can configure all your pods to run on Fargate, but can alse be flexible.
You can create a Fargate profile that speciies which pods shoul use Fagate when they are launched.

# Taints and tolerations

Tains are a property of node that prevent the placement of pods. A tainted node will note accept any pods that do not specificall tolerate the taint.
To taint a node, you specifu a key = value pair and then you add an action that defines when the taint is considered.

A toleration is a property of a pod that specifies that it can run on a tainted node. A toleration must matuch a specific taint.

# Affinity and Anti-Affinity

At times, you may need to make sure that a pod is scheduled on a specific node. Perhaps the pod requires a specific hardware resource, such as a GPU
or SSD. To make sure a pod runs on a specific node ore instance type, you can use affinity settings.

# Auto scaling

Auto scaling can also be configured for applications running in the data plane. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Kubernetes Metrics Server are supported by EKS.
