# What is Kubernets?

Kubernets is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. Kubernets defines a set o building blocks, which collectively provide mechanisms for deploying, maintaining and scaling applications.

# EKS features

Amazon EKS is a managerd Kubernetes control plane service that makes it easy to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS.
EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructures for you across multiple AWS availability zones to eliminate a single point of failure, meaning there is no control plane to manage.

# EKS architecture

Amazon EKS provides a scalable and highly available control plane. The Amazon EKS service automatically manages the avaialability and scalability of the Kubernets API servers and the etcd persistence layer for each cluster.
The EKS runs the Kubernets control plane across three availability zones to ensure high availability and it automatically detects and replaces unhealthy components.
