# Defining a volume

Kubernetes volumes allow containers of the same pod to share volumes, and volume data is not lost if a single container of the pod is terminated; non-persistent volumes have the same lifetime as the surrounding pod. A variety of volumes are supported, such as emptyDir, hostPath, awsElasticBlockStore and configMap, to name a few.

# EmptyDir volume

Volumes are configured in the PodSpec. You can also stae where to mount these volumes into containers. One volume can be used for multiple purposes: use the volumeMounts.subPath filed to define a sub-path inside of a referenced volume, instead of using root.

This is an example of an emptyDir volume. Itâ€™s created when a pod is assigned to a node, and it exists as long as that pod is running on that node. When a pod is removed from a node, the contents are lost. Containers in the same pod can all read and write to the same files in the emptyDir volume. The storage medium for the volume is determined by the medium of the file system holding the kubelet root directory (/var/lib/kubelet). Alternatively, you could create an in-memory emptyDir volume that would be mounted as a temporary file system. When using the emptyDir volume type, no isolation exists between containers or between pods and there is no limit on how much space the volume can consume.
