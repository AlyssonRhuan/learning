# Defining a volume

Kubernetes volumes allow containers of the same pod to share volumes, and volume data is not lost if a single container of the pod is terminated; non-persistent volumes have the same lifetime as the surrounding pod. A variety of volumes are supported, such as emptyDir, hostPath, awsElasticBlockStore and configMap, to name a few.

# EmptyDir volume

Volumes are configured in the PodSpec. You can also stae where to mount these volumes into containers. One volume can be used for multiple purposes: use the volumeMounts.subPath filed to define a sub-path inside of a referenced volume, instead of using root.

This is an example of an emptyDir volume. Itâ€™s created when a pod is assigned to a node, and it exists as long as that pod is running on that node. When a pod is removed from a node, the contents are lost. Containers in the same pod can all read and write to the same files in the emptyDir volume. The storage medium for the volume is determined by the medium of the file system holding the kubelet root directory (/var/lib/kubelet). Alternatively, you could create an in-memory emptyDir volume that would be mounted as a temporary file system. When using the emptyDir volume type, no isolation exists between containers or between pods and there is no limit on how much space the volume can consume. 

# HostPath volume

The hostPath volume mounts a file or directory from host node's filesystem into the pod and allows containers to access node filesystem items. When using hostPath, it's important to note that pods of the same configuration can bahave differently on diferent nodes.

# Persistent volumes

Persistent volumes are volumes that have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the volume. I EKS, you can use the awsElastivBlockStore volume type is that contants of the EBS volume are preserved and the volume is unmounted when a pod is removed instead of being destroyed as it would be with an emptyDir volume. To use this type, the EBS volume must be EC2 instances and in the same region and availability zones as the EBS volume.

# StorageClass

A Sotreage Class is a Kubernetes resource that provides a way for administrators to describe the 'classes' of storage they offer. In EKS the gp2 tier, StorageClass is created by default.

# Create a volume for use with a pod

After creating a YAML file to define the StorageClass, use kubectl to create the StorageClass from the manifest file.
