# Defining the problem

There is a range of problems to solve when designing a networking solution for distributed orchestration system, including:

- Inter-pod communication between containers.
- Communication between pods both on one node and on different nodes.
- Accessibility of services (one of the Kubernetes resources we discussed earlier) from pods.
- And, last but not least, ingress connections from the outside world to a cluster.

# Docker communication

By default, Docker uses a private host-level virtual bridhe with an addres range allocated by NAT from on of the standard private blocks. 
Theses days, Docker supports more networking models, but the above bridge model has been the default mode histprically and many ohter orchestration tools rely on it.

Within the model, containers have direct network connectivity between each other within one host, but they can't directly reach out to containers on other hosts, and they can't be accessed from and outside network.

To address this problem, Docker uses dynamic port allocation where a ramdom port from the host IP address is mapped to a container ip:port pair. This allows you to bridge the gap between a container's network and the host's network, but it requires the use of LoadBalancer with ip:port registration of backend containers.
