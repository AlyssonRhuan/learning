It' important to set up monitoring in the cloud. With the elastic nature of AWS services that dynamically scale up and down, you'll want to keep a close pulse on your AWS resources to ensure that your systems are running as expected.

# Amazon CloudWatch

Is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metric and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics.
Allows you to monitor your AWS infrastructure and the applications you run on AWS in real time.

CloudWatch uses metrics to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch the uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time.

Benefits of using a service such as CloudWatch
- Access all your metrics from a central location;
- Gain visibility into your application, infrastructure and services;
- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) and improve total cost of ownership (TCO);
- Drive insights to optimize applications and operational resources.

# AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail records API calls for your account. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, and more.
