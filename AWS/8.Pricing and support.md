# AWS Free Tier

Three types of offers are available:
- `Always free` offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers;
- `12 mounths free` offers are free 12 months following your initial sing-up date to AWS;
- `Trials` offers start from the date you activate a partivular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.
