# Typical use cases

1. Microservices: Java, Node.js, Go, web apps, etc.
2. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD);
3. Batch processing and ETL jobs;
4. Common platform-as-a-service (PaaS) stack for application deployment;
5. Legacy application migration to the cloud;
6. Hybrid workloads;
7. Artificial intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML);
8. Scale testing;
9. Backend for Internet of Things (IoT) use cases.

# Microservices with containers

The application with smaller micro-services, tou can reduce the impact of changes to any one of those services. And if the impact of change is small, release velocity can increase.
Microservices allow development teams to perform lots of incremental change and lots of experiments.

There are lots of different ways to build microservices. 
The whole point of a microservice is being able to make a change to one service and deploy it, without needing to change any other part of the system.
All communication between the services themselves are via network calls.

# Operating microservices

The first question that often comes up is around complexity. Isn't it more complex to opeate many 10s or 100s of services compared to a single monolith?
As a system there is definitely more complexity. But if done right , for each service team, owning a small set of a larger system simplifies operations even though your larger system may be more complex.
