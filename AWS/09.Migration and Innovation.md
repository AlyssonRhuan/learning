# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

At the highest level, the AWS CAF organizes guidance int six ares of focus, called Perspectives. Each Perspective addresses dinstinct responsibilities.
In general, the `Business`, `People` and `Governance` perspectives focus on business capabilities, whereas the `Platform`, `Security` and `Operations` perspectives focus on technical capabilities.

# Migration strategies

When migrating applications to the cloud, six of the most common migration strategies that you can implement are:
- `Rehosting` involves moving applications without changes;
- `Replatforming` involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application;
- `Refactoring/re-architecting` involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features. Refactioring is drive by a strong business need to add features, scale or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application's existing environment;
- `Repurchasing` involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model;
- `Retaining` consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment;
- `Retiring` is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.

# AWS Snow Family

Is a collection of physical devices that help to physically transport up to exabytes of data into and out AWS.

AWS Snow Family is composed of:
- `AWS Snowcone` is small, rugged and secure edge computing and data transfer devide. It features 2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, and 8 TB of usable storage;
- `AWS Snowball` offers two types of devices:
    - `Snowball Edge Storage Optimized` devices are well suited for large-scale data migrations and recurring transfer workflows, in addition to local computing with higher capacity needs.
        - Storage: 80 TB of hard disk drive (HDD) capacity for block volumes and Amazon S3 compatible object storage, and 1 TB of SATA solid state drive (SSD) for block volumes.
        - Compute: 40 vCPUs, and 80 GiB of memory to support Amazon EC2 sbe1 instances (equivalent to C5).
    - `Snowball Edge Compute Optimized` provides powerful computing resources for use cases such as machine learning, full motion video analysis, analytics, and local computing stacks.
        - Storage: 42-TB usable HDD capacity for Amazon S3 compatible object storage or Amazon EBS compatible block volumes and 7.68 TB of usable NVMe SSD capacity for Amazon EBS compatible block volumes. 
        - Compute: 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of memory, and an optional NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Devices run Amazon EC2 sbe-c and sbe-g instances, which are equivalent to C5, M5a, G3, and P3 instances.
- `AWS Snowmobile` is an exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move large amounts of data to AWS. You can transfer up to 100 petabytes of data per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi trailer truck.

# Innovate with AWS Services

When examining how to use AWS services, it is important to focus on the desired outcomes. You are properly equipped to drive innovation in the cloud if you can clearly articulate the following conditions: 

- The current state
- The desired state
- The problems you are trying to solve

## Serverless applications

With AWS, serverless refers to applications that don’t require you to provision, maintain, or administer servers. You don’t need to worry about fault tolerance or availability. AWS handles these capabilities for you.
AWS Lambda is an example of a service that you can use to run serverless applications. If you design your architecture to trigger Lambda functions to run your code, you can bypass the need to manage a fleet of servers.
Building your architecture with serverless applications enables your developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers.

## Artificial intelligence

AWS offers a variety of services powered by artificial intelligence (AI). 
For example, you can perform the following tasks:
- Convert speech to text with Amazon Transcribe.
- Discover patterns in text with Amazon Comprehend.
- Identify potentially fraudulent online activities with Amazon Fraud Detector.
- Build voice and text chatbots with Amazon Lex.

## Machine learning

Traditional machine learning (ML) development is complex, expensive, time consuming, and error prone. AWS offers Amazon SageMaker to remove the difficult work from the process and empower you to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly.
You can use ML to analyze data, solve complex problems, and predict outcomes before they happen.
