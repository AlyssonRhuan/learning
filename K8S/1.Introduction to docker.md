- A Quick Intro
    - Containers help application to package all its deps and libs into a single package.
    - Docker will ease the build, deploy and run of applications via containers.
    - Packaging structure in a docker is called as an image, and image in action is called as Container.
- In the Docker we have three main files
    - **Dockerfile**, is a base for building a docker image, contains what to build in a docker image, like dependencies, installations and applications.

        To build the image, run dockerfile with 'docker build' command;

    - **Image**, is a template created by running Dockerfile.

        To run a container, run image with 'docker run' command;

    - **Container**, is a image in action, use the system resources to make it active;
    - **OBS**: This is a layered Architecture, each of the above layer is dependent on below ones
- Working principle
    - **Docker Cliente**, is a any command prompt (like bash, powerShell) that can run docker commands. This commands are go to 'docker daemon' in Docker Server;
    - The **Docker daemon**, listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, cnotainers, networks and volumes.

        When the command is given, 'docker run' for example, the daemon will try to looking this images.

        If the image are available, the docker daemon are start the container of this particular image.

        If in case the image is not available, then docker daemon send the request to the Docker Hub to download this imagens and store locally.

    - **Docker Hub**, is a Container image library, and when the docker Server given the command, Docker Hub returns the image like a command.
