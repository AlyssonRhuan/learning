- Kubelet processes pod specs from the API server 
- Scheduler is responsible to indicate which worker node’s kubelet the API server must talk to when sending over the pod specs
- Kubelet interfaces with the configured container runtime to run the pods and contained containers 
- It is the container runtime which is responsible for pulling the images from the registry , creating the writable layer on top spinning up the containers and ultimately executing them 
- Kubelet is nothing more than an orchestrator triggered by the control plane 
- The image of the left is the earliest iteration of K8s where docker was used as the container runtime 

# Not necessarily a K8s construct

- Container runtimes are relatable from a pure docker construct 
- What we know as docker is a monolith that is docker CLI + docker dameon + Higher level container runtime + lower-level container runtime 
- The ‘brain’ in this monolithic app is the higher-level container runtime ( which is containerd) 
- Execution though is done by the lower-level container runtime which is runc by default 
- Lower-level container runtime can run any OCI compliant image – build image using podman or rkt and run it with docker CLI 
- This monolithic docker app must have never been used as-is in K8S  to start with 

# Container runtime interface

- Abstracts out the higher-level container runtime from orchestrator
- Implemented over gRPC.
- If higher-level container runtimes respect gRPC , they can be seamlessly added/switched  from any orchestrator

# Docker as container runtime

- Monolithic docker never ‘understood’ CRI 
- Quick-fix was done in the form of a shim which acted as mediatory between  kubelet and the monolithic app 
- Containerd was the ‘actual’ higher-level container runtime which was invoked by the monolithic docker app 
- Defacto choice for a long time – Fraught with vulnerabilities and inefficiencies 

# Iteration#2 of Docker container runtime

- Higher-level container runtime (containerD) of the monolithic app forked off as a separate project 
- A plugin that talks CRI was added directly to the runtime , eliminating the dockershim layer 
- Still packed in unnecessary and risky functionalities
- OCI runtime capabilities were maintained as-is

# Iteration#3 of Docker container runtime

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13942355/130048394-0f14591c-659f-4d73-ad9f-42a429b4a949.png)

- CRI compliant containerD sans the plugin 
- Plugin need is obsolete as CRI isn’t forecasted to have competing specifications
- Much faster when compared to previous iteration 
- OCI runtime capabilities were maintained as-is

# New entrant

- Similar to the containerD sans the plugin 
- Better security as it requires fewer linux capabilities 
- One of its kind monitoring tool ‘conmon’
- Works with all OCI runtimes.

# Not just about security
