Kubernetes is a open source, portable and extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services.
It's a framework for running resiliently distributed systems with benefits below:

1. `Self Healing`, restarting containers that fail or replacing containers;
2. `Dynamic Scaling`, scaling up or down based on deman;
3. `Rolling Updates`, rolling updates and rollbacks of containers.

# Cluster

When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster, and the cluster architecture it's composed by a `node` and `Control Plane`.

## Node

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called `nodes`, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

## Control Pane

The `control plane` manages the worker nodes in the cluster.

## Kubernetes Rosources

- A `Pod` are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. Is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.
- A `Job` creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate.
- A `Deployment` provides declarative updates for Pods ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
- A `ReplicaSet's` purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.
- A `ConfigMap` is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.
- A `Secret` is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in a container image. Using a Secret means that you don't need to include confidential data in your application code.
- `Service` is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
- `Ingress`, is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.
