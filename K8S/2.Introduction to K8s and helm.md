It's a framework for running resiliently distributed systems.

# Cluster

  When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster, and the cluster architecture it's composed by a `node`, `Control Panel` and `Cloud Provider API`.

  ## Node
  
  A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called `nodes`, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.
