Kubernetes is a open source, portable and extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services.
It's a framework for running resiliently distributed systems with benefits below:

1. `Self Healing`, restarting containers that fail or replacing containers;
2. `Dynamic Scaling`, scaling up or down based on deman;
3. `Rolling Updates`, rolling updates and rollbacks of containers.

# Cluster

When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster, and the cluster architecture it's composed by a `node` and `Control Plane`.

## Node

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called `nodes`, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

## Control Pane

The `control plane` manages the worker nodes in the cluster.

## Kubernetes Rosources

- `Pod` are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. Is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.
- `Job`
- `Deployment / ReplicaSet`
- `ConfigMap`
- `Secret`
- `Service`
- `Ingress`
