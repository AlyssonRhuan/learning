# Key principles to bear in mind.

- If possible, the scrum master should work on only one project at a time
- Working on multiple projects means divided attention
- The scrum master is not the boss he or she can coach
- He has no direct authority over the team and acts as a servant leader in keeping with scrum principles
- The scrum master should be an inspiration to the team, he or she should inspire them to learn about and know as much of scrum as they possibly can without forcing them to follow a routine
- A scrum master must render assistance to the team members
- Ensure they connect with the sprint and product commitments they made to themselves
- The scrum master should have undeniably high knowledge of the scrum theory and ensure its implementation
- The scrum guide is the rule book on scrum and should be the first port of call
- He or she has to ensure everyone in the team is in sync with everyone else.

## Done is relative to each particular team

- Scrum master has to ensure that the team members know what 'Done' means in their case
- The scrum master should not make decisions on behalf of other team members
- Every team member chooses what to do
- In scrum, there is no work assignment to team members. Instead, team members decide what to do and when to complete it
- The scrum master must not assign any work to the team members
- The team has to be self-organized
- No one should keep track of what the team members are doing
- Whatever impediments the team members encounter, whether in the sprint or elsewhere in the company, the scrum master must help remove them.

## Organising one on one mentoring sessions for the team members can be done when there's a need to promote growth.
- The scrum master can give input about how to improve product features
- A scrum master must place focus on team efficacy as opposed to individual abilities, in scrum projects, individual efficiency is an impediment to collaboration
- The scrum master has an active role in the Sprint retrospective as facilitator in the team's search
for improvements.
- The team should not over commit to what they can do in a sprint, and it is the scrum masters duty to coach them on this point.

# How to improve product owner efficiency

- The roles of a scrum master and those of a product owner overlap in a few cases for the efficient running of the project.
- The individuals involved in those roles should collaborate effectively as co-workers
- Although the product owner has greater authority in achieving the goals of the business, both the product owner and the scrum master share a common goal the desire to create a viable product using scrum framework

## To achieve this objective in full, the scrum master and product owner must collaborate in the following areas

- Improve product backlog
    - The product owner is responsible for the product backlog
    - The scrum master is in an ideal position to help the product owner spruce it up
- It is much easier and more effective for the scrum master to give input when the results of each sprint retrospective are still fresh in his or her mind

## Boosting team communication.

- The scrum master works more directly with the team every day
- The product owner, who may go four days before seeing the team
- The product owner must make sure all necessary communications pertaining to the project and the product vision are very clear to every member of the team.
- The scrum Masters proximity to the team can ensure that a collaboration between the scrum master and the product owner leads to more effective delivery of necessary messages to all levels, teams and departments of the organization.

## Improving team morale

- Collaboration between the scrum master and the product owner throughout the development process can elevate a team's spirits and increase the team productivity

## Ensuring interdependencies with other teams

- The scrum master should have close relationships with other teams, product owners, scrum masters working on different projects, as well as past team members who could be working elsewhere in the organization
- He or she must help foster such relationships between the product owner and the team and those of other groups
- Promotion of such relationships can help both the scrum master and the product owner improve on the project they're working on and clear any impediments along the way

## Assistant product vision clarification

- Although the product owner is responsible for effectively communicating the product vision 
- Collaborative work between him or her, the scrum master and the enablement of full engagement in the vision can boost the clear inappropriate communication of that vision

## Offer insight

In the case of a sprint that did not go as well as everyone expected. 
- The scrum master can assist the product owner by bringing insight about the sprint to allow improvements on the next sprint.

# How to improve the development team.

The scrum master is the scrum expert and therefore the Go-To person, if anyone has a question about implementing anything about scrum in the scrum team in particular.

## But even in the organization as a whole?

- This position means a scrum master has to know a lot about scrum 
- When you're a scrum master, although you have no authority over the team, you have it over the process and therefore are to the scrum process what the product owner is to the product.

You're responsible for ensuring that a scrum team lives by the practices or values of scrum and to do everything possible to ensure the team performs to the highest level possible.

## The scrum master does this through the following.

- Ensuring the scrum team works as well as they possibly can within the scrum framework
- Encourages the team by facilitating daily stand up meetings that reinforce the product owner's product vision

Being a capable process owner through keeping the team on track by ensuring they follow due and recognized procedures.

- Making sure the development team is not distracted when it's working on a sprint
- he scrum master has to provide a buffer between the team and all external distractions in order to help the team members keep their mind on the sprint
- helping the team watch over and take care of their scrum tools, storyboard action board charts, backlogs, et cetera
- Helping the team to find and work on a suitable definition of done

Protecting the team from complacency that can emerge when they've done several sprints efficiently and now believe they're above mistakes. By being a good role model to the team through embodying agile and scrum values.

- Giving constant reminders to the team pertaining to their arrangements and procedural commitments
- Helping the team continuously improve their process by workshopping them and through improving their own knowledge of the process
- Observing process and process implementation without the team to enable the practical reflection of issues to the team
- Asking the team members open questions that warrant analysis, which promotes serious considerations of situations
- Checking all the models the team uses, e.g. sprint backlog metrics, et cetera, and showing the differences between these models in the actual world
- Suggesting tools the team can use as stimuli to improve and change

Organising exchange events where the team can meet other scrum teams and exchange ideas.
