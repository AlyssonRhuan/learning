# Scrum team rolls

Scrum simplifies projects down to only three rows. The three roles are:

1. `The scrum Masters` purpose is to understand the scrum rules and practices, remove any impediments or blockers to the team delivering and to help the team to understand how to self-organize and work in a scrum manner. Is the facilitators for the scrum team.
2. `The product owner` is responsible for creating requirements on behalf of the business. He prioritizes based on business needs and is responsible for managing the product backlog. The product owner is responsible for making decisions that maximize return on investment and for making priority calls or trade offs to maximize the product's value.
3. `The development team` are responsible for building a potentially releasable product increment in each sprint. The idea is that if push came to shove, development team members would collaborate to perform tasks outside of their role to deliver the product. The development team are self-organizing and collaborative, as well as skilled in whatever is needed to deliver the project.

One key difference between Scrum and many other frameworks is that the development team are explicitly experts in their field as opposed to controlled resources. They look to the scrum master for coaching guidance and the removal of impediments. They look to the product owner for clear requirements, prioritization and trade, of course.
