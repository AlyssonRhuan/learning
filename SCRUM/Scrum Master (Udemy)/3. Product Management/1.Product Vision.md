# How to create a product using the scrum framework

- As discussed, product development progresses through a series of sprints, iterations
- sprints or time boxed to between one and four weeks, it entails a number of different events meetings.

Here's a flavor of how you'd be involved with each of these meetings as a product owner

## The really first meeting

- This meeting is a behind the scenes meeting. It's the meeting during which the key stakeholders discuss the requirements for a product with the product owner.

- After a number of meetings like this, the product owner puts all requirements into perspective and aligns them with a vision for the product.
- In reality, there may be a number of these meetings before the vision is finalized.
